## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
I’m a software developer with a strong interest in backend engineering, system-level programming, and building practical tools that solve real problems. I enjoy working close to the logic of a system—designing APIs, automation workflows, and performance-focused components rather than just surface-level features.<br><br>I like understanding how things work end-to-end, from low-level execution to user-facing interfaces. My projects often focus on clean architecture, reliability, and clarity, with an emphasis on building software that could realistically be used in production.<br><br>I’m continuously sharpening my skills by building real projects, documenting my decisions, and challenging myself with systems that require discipline, structure, and thoughtful design.
